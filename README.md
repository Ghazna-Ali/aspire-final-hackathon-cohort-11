# 🤖 Career Assistant AI

**Career Assistant AI** is a Gemini-powered, multi-agent AI career assistant designed to help job seekers analyze opportunities, improve their CVs, research companies, prepare applications, practice interviews, and identify weaknesses in their career materials.

Built with **Python, Streamlit, Google Gemini, and specialized AI agents**, the application provides users with direct control over which career task they want the AI to perform.

Instead of automatically running every agent, users can **select the specialized agent they need**, provide their career information, and receive a focused AI-generated analysis.

At the end of each workflow, the generated result can also be turned into a **downloadable career report**.

---

## 🌟 Overview

---

# 🔄 How Career Assistant AI Works

Career Assistant AI follows a **selective-agent architecture**.

Unlike a system where every agent automatically executes in sequence, the user decides which specialized agent to use.

### Step 1 — Open the application

The application is deployed through Streamlit.

The interface provides the user with access to the available career agents.

---

### Step 2 — Select an agent

The user chooses the task they want help with.

For example:

```text
Agent:
[ Job Analyst ▼ ]
```

Other options include:

```text
Manager
Job Analyst
CV Analyst
Research Agent
Application Agent
Interview Agent
Critic Agent
```

---

### Step 3 — Provide career information

Depending on the selected task, the user provides relevant information such as:

* Job description
* CV
* Career background
* Skills
* Experience
* Company information
* Target role
* Interview context

---

### Step 4 — Execute the selected agent

Only the selected agent is executed.

For example:

```text
User selects:
Job Analyst

        ↓

Job Analyst receives the input

        ↓

Gemini API processes the request

        ↓

Job analysis is generated
```

The other agents are not unnecessarily executed.

This makes the workflow more direct and user-controlled.

---

### Step 5 — Display the result

The AI-generated analysis is displayed inside the Streamlit application.

The user can review the generated information and recommendations.

---

### Step 6 — Generate a downloadable report

After the analysis is generated, Career Assistant AI provides the result in a downloadable report format.

This allows users to retain the generated career analysis rather than relying only on the temporary Streamlit session.

# 🔐 Gemini API Configuration

Career Assistant AI uses the **Google Gemini API** to generate AI-powered career analysis.

The application requires a Gemini API key.

The application can detect whether the required Gemini API configuration is available.

Example application status:

```text
System Status

Gemini API key detected
```

The API key should be stored securely and should **not be hard-coded into the source code or committed to GitHub**.

For local development, environment variables or Streamlit secrets should be used.

---

```

**Important:** These are separate user-selected workflows. Career Assistant AI does not automatically execute all of these agents as one mandatory pipeline. The user chooses which agent to run at each stage.

# 🎨 User Interface

The Streamlit interface is designed around a simple interaction model:

```text
⚙️ Career Assistant AI

Agent
[ Select an agent ]

        ↓

Career / Job Information

        ↓

[ Run Agent ]

        ↓

AI Generated Analysis

        ↓

[ Download Report ]
```

The interface also displays system status information, including whether the Gemini API configuration has been detected.

# 🔒 Security Considerations

Career Assistant AI may process sensitive career information such as:

* CVs
* Employment history
* Skills
* Education
* Job applications
* Career goals
* Company information

Users should therefore avoid exposing sensitive information unnecessarily.

### API key security

Never store API keys directly in:

```python
# ❌ Do not do this
GEMINI_API_KEY = "my-secret-api-key"
```

Instead, use environment variables or secure deployment secrets.

### GitHub security

Before pushing code to GitHub, ensure that secrets are not included in:

* Python files
* `.env` files
* Configuration files
* Notebooks
* Logs
* Commit history

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

Career Assistant AI is an AI-powered assistance tool and its outputs should be reviewed by the user.

AI-generated recommendations may contain:

* Incorrect interpretations
* Missing context
* Inaccurate assumptions
* Overly general recommendations
* Incorrectly inferred relationships between skills and job requirements

The system should therefore be used as a **career assistance and preparation tool**, rather than as a replacement for the user's own judgment.

The quality of the output also depends on the quality and completeness of the information provided to the selected agent.

# 🧪 Development Philosophy

Career Assistant AI follows a modular architecture.

Instead of putting all career functionality into a single large AI prompt, the application separates responsibilities into specialized agents.

```text
One General AI
      │
      │
      ▼
Specialized Career Agents
      │
      ├── Job Analysis
      ├── CV Analysis
      ├── Research
      ├── Applications
      ├── Interviews
      ├── Criticism
      └── Career Overview
```

This separation makes it easier to:

* Maintain the application
* Improve individual agents
* Add new career capabilities
* Modify prompts independently
* Debug specific workflows
* Give users direct control over the task being performed

# 📈 Project Goals

The main goals of Career Assistant AI are to:

1. Simplify the job-search process.
2. Help candidates understand job requirements.
3. Improve alignment between CVs and job descriptions.
4. Assist with tailored application materials.
5. Help candidates prepare for interviews.
6. Identify weaknesses before applications are submitted.
7. Provide structured, reusable career reports.
8. Give users control over which AI capability they want to use.

# 🏆 Why Career Assistant AI?

Traditional job applications require candidates to manually switch between many different tools.

For example:

```text
Job Description
      ↓
Manual Analysis
      ↓
CV Editing
      ↓
Company Research
      ↓
Cover Letter
      ↓
Interview Preparation
      ↓
Manual Review
```

Career Assistant AI brings these capabilities into a single application:

```text
             Career Assistant AI
                     │
       ┌─────────────┼──────────────┐
       │             │              │
    Analyze         Improve       Prepare
       │             │              │
       ▼             ▼              ▼
     Jobs           CVs         Interviews
       │             │              │
       └─────────────┼──────────────┘
                     ▼
              Review & Report
```

The user remains in control of which capability to use.

## ⭐ Summary

**Career Assistant AI** provides a centralized AI-powered workspace for career analysis and job-application preparation.

Users can select a specialized agent based on their current need:

```text
Manager
Job Analyst
CV Analyst
Research Agent
Application Agent
Interview Agent
Critic Agent
```

The selected agent processes the user's career information through the Gemini API and produces a focused result. The result can then be converted into a **downloadable report**, giving the user a reusable record of the analysis.

The architecture is modular, user-controlled, and designed to make AI-assisted career preparation more structured and accessible.
